\section{Orthogonality relation}\label{orthogonality-relation}

\textbf{Orthogonality relations} are used pervasively throughout linear
logic models, being often used to define somehow the duality operator
\((-)\orth\).

Let us now assume an orthogonality relation over \(A\) and \(B\).

Orthogonal sets define Galois connections and share many common
properties.
